Scinia is an analytics framework to help me make charts and graphs about my life.

Peices 
  fetching:   Scripts to download interesting data from devices and websites [ComingSoon™]
  processing: An appliation that parses raw data formats and loads everything into a database. Also mang
  web:        A static website with various visualizations projects and scripts to generate visualization data from the processing db.

The goal here is to transition from one-off scripts that generate 1 graph, to a whole suite of reusable components that make it easy for me to create vizualization projects that can be automatically updated.

data sources:
  Google Hangouts Chat
  Google Chat (pre-2014)
  Google Voice
  Skype
  iPhone messages backup (iMessage and SMS)
  LastFM scrobbles
  Facebook Chat [ComingSoon™]
  Foursquare/Swarm Checkins [ComingSoon™]
  Google Latitude [ComingSoon™]


Scinia is the 3rd interation of this project, here are my previous attempts at something like this:

V1 2011 Lacinia https://github.com/Chandler/Lacina
A mismash of terrible PHP scripts that I wrote in college
to visualize my skype and google voice messages.

V2 2012, Rcinia https://github.com/Chandler/rcinia
Armed with 2 months experience learning ruby, I tried (with some success) to rewrite
Lacinia into a Rails app that could support many different vizualizations
